All the hiring managers want the "rockstars" but I think the highly productive engineers are sorta burnt out on speaking to lots of hiring people. 

I dont know how the normal hiring manager operates and am certainly not blaming them but the highly productive programmers want something more interesting than a 30 minute call to discuss "corporate values" and then hear about so-so salary. 

Of course, if the hiring manager opens with a salary of 100ferraris per month or whatever great benefits then they will be flooded with overconfident juniors. 

Seems like a no win market.
