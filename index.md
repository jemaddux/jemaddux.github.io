I am a Principal Software Engineer specializing in Ruby on Rails. I have been working as a software engineer since 2013. I write at blog.dragonastronauts.com. I also run Dragon Astronauts LLC which is my private company for my various money making fun projects (Hieroglyph, Go Run/AirRun). I have built publically available Ruby Gems (Lorem Tolkien and Tiedye). I am familiar with Ruby on Rails, Jekyll, React, Node.js and React Native and have worked in various other languages and frameworks (I learn fast). 

I have worked at BrightWhistle, Influence Health, One Click Politics, ClickFunnels and Debtbook (see more on my resume). 

I went to school at the Turing School of Software and Design to learn software engineering.

I went to Georgia Institute of Technology for International Affairs.
